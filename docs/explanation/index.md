## About Explanations

Explanation documentation helps you understand broader contexts and implications while seeing connections between different concepts. It enables you to grasp theoretical foundations that underpin the practical aspects of your work. Through these deeper insights, you can make more informed decisions and develop genuine expertise that goes beyond surface-level knowledge.

Unlike other documentation types:

- **Not step-by-step** like tutorials or how-to guides
- **Not just facts** like reference documentation
- **Discussion-oriented** rather than action-oriented
- **Conceptual** rather than practical

Read explanations when you want to understand the "why" behind things.
