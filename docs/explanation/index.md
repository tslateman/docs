## About Explanations

Explanation documentation helps you:

- Understand broader contexts and implications
- See connections between different concepts
- Grasp theoretical foundations
- Make informed decisions
- Develop deeper expertise

Unlike other documentation types:

- **Not step-by-step** like tutorials or how-to guides
- **Not just facts** like reference documentation
- **Discussion-oriented** rather than action-oriented
- **Conceptual** rather than practical

Read explanations when you want to understand the "why" behind things.
