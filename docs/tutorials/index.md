# Tutorials

Learning-oriented guides that teach through hands-on practice.

## Available Tutorials

### Documentation Fundamentals

While we develop comprehensive documentation tutorials, explore our [How-To Guides](../how-to/index.md) for practical documentation tasks.

### AI at Work

Start your AI journey with our [AI Tutorials](../ai/tutorials/index.md), including the popular [Getting Started with AI Adoption Documentation](../ai/tutorials/getting-started-ai-adoption-docs.md).

## Upcoming Tutorials

We're developing new tutorials to expand your documentation skills:

## What to Expect

Our tutorials guide you through complete learning experiences. Each tutorial includes clear prerequisites, helps you build something real, and leaves you with practical skills you can apply immediately.

Unlike how-to guides that assume expertise, tutorials are designed for learners. We explain not just what to do, but why each step matters.
