    | **Human Oversight** | Meaningful human control | Review mechanisms |

=== "Risk-Based Regulation"

    | **Risk Level** | **Applications** | **Regulatory Approach** |
    |:--------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|
    | **Minimal Risk** | Spam filters, games | Self-regulation |
    | **Limited Risk** | Chatbots, content moderation | Transparency obligations |
    | **High Risk** | Healthcare, hiring, law enforcement | Pre-market approval |
    | **Unacceptable Risk** | Social scoring, mass surveillance | Prohibition |

### Step 5: Design Implementation Mechanisms

Establish comprehensive regulatory infrastructure:

|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| • Licensing requirements<br>• Audit procedures<br>• Certification programs<br>• Compliance monitoring<br>• Enforcement actions | • Advisory bodies<br>• Technical standards<br>• Best practices<br>• Industry guidance<br>• Public education |

### Step 6: Create Adaptive Policies

Build flexibility into your regulatory framework to ensure it remains relevant as technology evolves. Implement regular review cycles with defined triggers for updates, establish regulatory sandboxes for testing innovative applications, and create pilot programs that allow controlled experimentation before full-scale deployment.

### Step 7: Foster International Coordination

Collaborate on global governance initiatives:

<div class="grid" markdown>

| **Area** | **Focus** | **Mechanisms** |
|:---------|:----------|:---------------|
| **Standards** | Common technical requirements | ISO/IEC committees |
| **Data Flows** | Cross-border transfers | Adequacy decisions |
| **Enforcement** | Regulatory cooperation | Mutual recognition |
| **Ethics** | Shared principles | International forums |
