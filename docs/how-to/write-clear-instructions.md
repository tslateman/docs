# Write Clear Instructions

Learn how to write step-by-step instructions that users can follow successfully.

## Overview

Clear instructions eliminate guesswork. This guide teaches you to write unambiguous, complete steps that users can follow confidently and verify their success.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of your subject matter
- Access to the system you're documenting
- Ability to test your instructions

## Steps

### 1. Start with the End Goal

Begin by stating the outcome clearly. Tell users exactly what they'll accomplish: "By the end of this guide, you will have configured your development environment" or "This process enables automated deployments."

### 2. List All Prerequisites

Eliminate surprises by listing everything users need upfront. Include software versions, permissions, required knowledge, and realistic time estimates. Missing prerequisites frustrate users and derail their progress.

### 3. Break Down into Clear Steps

Write each step as a single, numbered action starting with a verb. Include the expected result so users know they've succeeded. Keep steps atomic—one action, one outcome.

Example:

```
1. Open the configuration file
2. Find the `port` setting
3. Change the value to `8080`
4. Save the file
```

### 4. Add Context and Warnings

Explain the "why" behind critical steps. Warn users about common pitfalls and provide recovery instructions. This context transforms mechanical steps into understanding.

### 5. Use Consistent Formatting

Maintain visual consistency throughout your instructions. Use **bold** for UI elements

- `Code formatting` for commands
- *Italics* for emphasis
- Consistent terminology

### 6. Include Examples

Show don't just tell:

- Provide sample commands
- Show expected output
- Include screenshots where helpful

## Verification

Test your instructions by:

- Following them yourself in a clean environment
- Having someone else test them
- Checking for ambiguity

## Common Pitfalls

The most common mistakes stem from expert blindness. Don't assume prior knowledge or skip "obvious" steps—what's obvious to you may be mysterious to users. Define jargon on first use and keep each step focused on a single action.
