# Developer Documentation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines best practices for writing effective developer
documentation based on proven principles that improve collaboration,
onboarding, and project adoption.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity

- Use plain, accessible language
- Define all technical terms and acronyms on first use
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Write for your audience's knowledge level

### 2. Conciseness

- Include only necessary information
- Focus on core use cases (80% of usage)
- Create separate documents for edge cases
- Every sentence should add value

### 3. Structure

- Place most important information first
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Limit text highlighting to 10% or less
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout

## Documentation Framework: Diátaxis

Organize documentation into four distinct categories:

### Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)

- **Purpose**: Help newcomers learn
- **Format**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Focus**: Building understanding through practice
- **Example**: "Getting Started with Project X"

### How-To Guides (Task-Oriented)

- **Purpose**: Solve specific problems
- **Format**: Procedural steps
- **Focus**: Achieving particular goals
- **Example**: "How to Deploy to Production"

### Explanations (Understanding-Oriented)

- **Purpose**: Provide conceptual clarity
- **Format**: Descriptive prose
- **Focus**: Why things work the way they do
- **Example**: "Architecture Overview"

### Reference (Information-Oriented)

- **Purpose**: Provide technical specifications
- **Format**: Structured data
- **Focus**: Accurate, complete information
- **Example**: "API Reference"

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create Templates

Develop consistent templates for each documentation type:

- README template
- API documentation template
- Tutorial template
- Architecture decision record (ADR) template

### 2. Documentation Checklist

Before publishing, ensure each document:

- [ ] Has a clear, single purpose
- [ ] Uses appropriate category from Diátaxis framework
- [ ] Follows the three core principles
- [ ] Includes necessary context
- [ ] Has been reviewed for clarity

### 3. Regular Maintenance

- Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
- Identify and prioritize gaps
- Update outdated information
- Remove obsolete content

## Quick Reference

### Do's

- Start with user needs
- Use examples liberally
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Test instructions yourself
- Keep language consistent

### Don'ts

- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Don't mix documentation types
- Don't over-highlight text
- Don't neglect maintenance
- Don't write without purpose

## Benefits of Good Documentation

1. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can work independently
2. **Faster Onboarding**: New developers become productive quickly
3. **Increased Adoption**: Users can easily understand and use your project
4. **Reduced Support Burden**: Common questions are already answered
5. **Better Code Quality**: Documentation encourages thoughtful design

## Getting Started

1. Audit existing documentation
2. Identify biggest gaps
3. Choose appropriate Diátaxis category
4. Apply core principles
5. Use templates for consistency
6. Review and iterate

Remember: Good documentation is an investment that pays dividends through
improved productivity and reduced friction for everyone who interacts with
your project.
