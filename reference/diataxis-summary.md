# Diátaxis Documentation Framework Summary

## Overview

Diátaxis is a systematic approach to organizing technical documentation based on understanding fundamental user needs. It provides a theoretical framework that categorizes all documentation into four distinct types, each serving a specific purpose.

## Core Theory

The framework is built on two fundamental dimensions:

### 1. Action vs Cognition

- **Action**: Practical, procedural knowledge ("knowing how")
- **Cognition**: Theoretical, conceptual knowledge ("knowing that")

### 2. Acquisition vs Application

- **Acquisition**: Learning mode - when users are studying or acquiring new knowledge
- **Application**: Working mode - when users are applying knowledge to solve problems

## The Four Documentation Types

### Tutorials (Learning + Action)

- **Purpose**: Guide beginners through learning experiences
- **Characteristics**:
  - Step-by-step lessons
  - Hands-on practice
  - Safe learning environment
- **User mindset**: "I want to learn how to do this"

### How-to Guides (Working + Action)

- **Purpose**: Help users accomplish specific tasks
- **Characteristics**:
  - Goal-oriented recipes
  - Assume basic competence
  - Focus on practical outcomes
- **User mindset**: "I need to solve this problem"

### Reference (Working + Cognition)

- **Purpose**: Provide technical information
- **Characteristics**:
  - Accurate, complete descriptions
  - Structured for quick lookup
  - Neutral, factual tone
- **User mindset**: "I need to know about this"

### Explanation (Learning + Cognition)

- **Purpose**: Deepen understanding
- **Characteristics**:
  - Context and background
  - Discussion of concepts
  - Alternative perspectives
- **User mindset**: "I want to understand this"

## Key Principles

### 1. Clear Boundaries

Each documentation type must maintain its distinct purpose. Mixing types creates confusion and reduces effectiveness.

### 2. User-Centric Design

Documentation should align with the user's current context and needs, not the author's organizational preferences.

### 3. Complete Coverage

These four types comprehensively address all practitioner documentation needs - no gaps, no overlaps.

### 4. Quality Dimensions

- **Functional Quality**: Objective measures (accuracy, completeness, consistency)
- **Deep Quality**: Subjective experience (flow, anticipation of needs, elegance)

## Practical Application

### Navigation Questions

To categorize content, ask:

1. Is the user learning or working?
2. Do they need practical steps or conceptual understanding?

### Common Pitfalls

- Mixing tutorial steps into reference material
- Adding explanatory content to how-to guides
- Including task instructions in conceptual explanations
- Creating reference material that teaches

## Benefits

1. **For Writers**: Clear framework for organizing and creating content
2. **For Users**: Predictable structure that matches their needs
3. **For Teams**: Common vocabulary and shared understanding
4. **For Products**: More effective, maintainable documentation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Audit**: Examine existing documentation
2. **Identify**: Determine which type each piece should be
3. **Refactor**: Separate mixed content into appropriate types
4. **Iterate**: Make incremental improvements over time

## Conclusion

Diátaxis transforms documentation from an ad-hoc collection of information into a systematic, user-centered resource. By understanding and respecting the fundamental differences in how people seek and use information, it enables the creation of documentation that truly serves its users' needs.
